# OPO Search System

## Overview
OPO Search System is an Assembly-based application designed to simulate the organ donation coordination process managed by Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs).  
The system models the relationship between donors and distribution centers using graph structures, helping identify the nearest available organ for a given request.

## Project Context
This project was inspired by the outstanding performance of the OPO in the northwest region of São Paulo, Brazil — the national leader in organ donation rates.  
The system aims to support this process by automating the search and matching of organs between potential donors and hospitals or distribution centers.

## Features
- Graph representation using adjacency matrix in Assembly  
- Storage of donors and distribution centers data  
- Organ search algorithm for nearest available match  
- Text-based user interface for interaction  
- Display of organ availability and matching results  

## Team
- **Daniel Monteiro Ribeiro** — Graph structure implementation  
- **Davi de Souza Santos** — Organ search algorithm  
- **João Vitor Moreira Gomes** — Data management and input processing  
- **Thiago Sole Gomes Heleno** — Text-based interface and visualization  

## Development Period
**Start:** October 27, 2025  
**Delivery:** December 9, 2025
